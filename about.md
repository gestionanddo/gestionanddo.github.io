My name is **Gestionanddo**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am an PhD candidate in *Electrical Engineering* at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/) at **University of Pennsylvania**. I am licensed as a Professional Engineer (P.E) to practice in the states of Texas, Massachusetts and California. I double majored in EECS and Mathematics during my undergraduate life at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/), and currently focusing on Electrical Engineering for my post-graduate studies.

Anyways, for now I'm just working toward changing the face of Electrical Engineering forever. Not that I necessarily expect to succeed, but it's something to strive for, and it's a fun problem to work on.

I
make
stuff.

*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.
*I love what I do.*

But over the years, I noticed that somehow, along the way, software designed to help us be creative, actually made us less creative. That's because we believe our best ideas emerge when we use pencils and paper.
So I set out to build tools that work the way I do.

Tools for the creative space â€” the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, I  really can't imagine work without them.
